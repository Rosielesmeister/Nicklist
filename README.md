1. Project Overview
This capstone project involves building Nicklist, a full-stack web application designed to support public posting and browsing of categorized user-generated content. The platform allows registered users to post listings under various categories, while all visitors can view and search through available content.
The application emphasizes usability, performance, and clean architecture, focusing on real-world full-stack implementation patterns such as CRUD operations, user authentication, and secure backend logic.
The project will include:
Interfaces for creating, reading, updating, and deleting listings


Public and authenticated user flows


Category-based filtering and keyword search


Administrative controls (optional stretch)


Backend services will support:
Secure authentication and role-based access control


Structured data modeling and storage


Media upload (images) and scalable querying


This project uses the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), providing experience with end-to-end web development and practical deployment workflows.

2. Objectives
Build a Functional Full-Stack Application
Implement a multi-user listing system with category filtering


Enable post creation, editing, and deletion for authenticated users


Strengthen Technical Proficiency
Apply CRUD principles in a production-like context


Use secure authentication and database design practices


Integrate image/file upload and full deployment process


Deliver a Proof of Concept
Build an interactive, demo-ready prototype


Provide a responsive, accessible, and intuitive interface

3. Core Features
3.1 Post Management
Create, read, update, and delete listings


Assign categories and upload images


Auto-expiration or visibility toggle for listings (optional)


3.2 Public Browsing
Visitors can view all posts without logging in


Filter by category


Search by keyword


3.3 User Authentication
User registration, login, and logout


JWT-based secure auth and hashed passwords


Access control to prevent unauthorized editing


3.4 User Dashboard
View/manage own listings


Edit or remove existing posts


Optional: basic analytics (e.g., number of views per post)


3.5 Backend Integration
MongoDB for structured document storage


Express routes for API endpoints


Image hosting via Cloudinary or S3


Deployment with MongoDB Atlas + Vercel/Render
3.6 Region-Based Listings
Users select a region (e.g., city or state) when creating a post


Region is stored and associated with each listing


Public users can filter listings by region



4. Stretch Goals
Admin dashboard for content moderation


Messaging system between users


Bookmarking/saved posts


Location-based search


Notification system (email or in-app)



5. Success Criteria
Working MVP with full CRUD and auth


Secure backend and clean API structure


Search and filtering functionality


Responsive frontend design


Proper documentation



6. Learning Outcomes
End-to-end development using MERN stack


Implementation of secure user auth


RESTful API and route handling


Cloud integration for media


Realistic project management
